Worked with Jathuson Daniel (500832699)

Accomplishments:
InsertionSort works well using the metrics header with both even and odd arrays. The sorted array and the metrics for the sort are both outputted.

MergeSort works well using the metrics header with both even and odd arrays. The sorted array and the metrics for the sort are both outputted. I did run into to trouble trying to implement sorting for odd arrays but I have fixed it.I might have not run enough cases to fully flesh out the code but it works with base cases.

Analysis:
InsertionSort:-
Best Case-      Comparisons: 9
		Swaps: 0
		Copy operations: 20

Average Case-   Comparisons: 19
		Swaps: 15
		Copy operations: 14

Worst Case-	Comparisons: 45
		Swaps: 45
		Copy operations: 20

MergeSort:-
Best Case-	Comparisons: 53
		Swaps: 0
		Copy operations: 68

Average Case-   Comparisons: 33
		Swaps: 0
		Copy operations: 40

Worst Case- 	Comparisons: 53
		Swaps: 0
		Copy operations: 68
