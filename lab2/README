Worked with Jathuson Daniel (500832699).

I fixed the towersMain.c file to get rid of the bugs and run the program according to the lab manual. I also learned or futhered my understanding of how the towers of hanoi worked during this lab.


Questions

A. 1. The first recursive call to the towers() will be towers(0,1,3)
   2. Before returning to the intial invocation, towers() will be called upon 5 times 
   3. Move#1: From Tower 2 to Tower 3
   4. The second recursive call to the towers() will be towers(1,3,1)
B. 255 lines will be printed to stdout
